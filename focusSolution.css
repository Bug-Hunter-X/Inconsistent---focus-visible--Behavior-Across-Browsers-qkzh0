/* Potential Solution 1: Using JavaScript to detect focus visibility */
.focusable {
  outline: none; /* Remove default outline */
}

.focusable:focus {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px #007bff; /* Custom focus style */
}

// JavaScript to check if focus is programmatically set and apply or remove style accordingly. This is not foolproof, but can improve consistency across browsers.

/* Potential Solution 2:  Fallback styles (less precise but more widely supported)*/
.focusable:focus {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px #007bff; /* Style for all focus events */
}

/*Consider adding more specific styles to override the default styles for different browsers or assistive technologies*/
